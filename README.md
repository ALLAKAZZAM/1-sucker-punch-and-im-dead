Ronnette, my dear, don't ever disappear
Do what you want as long as you stay here
I need you now, I love you so much, more than you could know

The Christmas kids were nothing but a gift
And love is a tower where all of us can live
You'll change your name or change your mind
And leave this fucked up place behind

But I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know

Appearing unsightly with devils inside me

If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
I'm leaving, Phil, I'm leaving now

I'm going to escape, but you won't know how
Or where to find me when I'm gone
I'll drink myself to death inside this prison cell
This prison cell

So get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

You'll change your name or change your mind
And leave this fucked up place behind

But I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
