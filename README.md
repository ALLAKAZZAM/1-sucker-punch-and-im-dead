Do I need a reason to wake up lonely all the time?

I don't want to see you, but I don't know where to hide

Some mistakes should not be made

Like opening your heart

If your heart's upon your sleeve

Then amputate the arm

Swim in circles, water fills your lungs

And why should anyone else offer their help?

I mean, just look at the way you never took care of yourself

I'll be numb, but I'll be free

My friends will keep me honest

My friends will keep me honest

You won't mean a thing to me

Now that's what I call progress

That's what I call progress

That's what I call progress

Is this what you mean when you say that you're making it, easier,

easier?

Now you want the feelings back

Now that you're an actor

And phantom pains cannot convince

Or captivate an audience

Your monologue was such a mess,

A reprehensible pretense

Guilt's a modus operandi

You thought that **hope** was so profound

What if true love doesn't wait

for everyone to come around?

Everyone to come around

Everyone to come around

Everyone to come around

Everyone to come around

Everyone to come around

Everyone to come around

Everyone to come around
